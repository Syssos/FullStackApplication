1. Bring TypeScript into the project.
2. Start utilizing additional tools such as Hotjar to monitor site traffic
3. Start focusing on SEO best practices, getting media on CDN's, and Ensure site data is loading without major time costing hicups


4. Version 3 will need to handle everything covered in version 1 and 2 with the idea of speed and scalability in mind. Typescript helps 
   keep code organized as the project builds, React is universal and can be deployed an a wide range of platforms, CDN's speed up load times
   for media, and the tools that get utilized for SEO and Site traffic help the developers see where they need to focus their attention.
