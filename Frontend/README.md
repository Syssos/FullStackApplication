# Full Stack Application - Front ends
This directory holds all versions of the applications Front-end. Each version may have different paradigms and programming models, or even use different languages, but will acheive the same task. Each version will contain its own README file, breaking down why certain technologies where used, what can be improved, as well as what is benificial or hindering when taking this approach.

## Frontend - Version 1
This version will make use of standard HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It will also use some javascript libraries such as Bootstrap to quickly style the website. The focus is on javascript collecting data from the API and displaying it correctly on the webpage. This version should be super lightweight, and deployable via many different means. Initially this project will rely on flask delivering the content, however this will change as the front end nears its final version to be deployable through many services like Github and AWS

## Frontend - Version 2
Version 2 will take things up a notch by utilizing the React library. The project will then rely on caching data and application states. The goal is to turn the front end into a "universal" application handling everything from small mobile phone screen to large platforms such as smart tv's. Version 2 will also keep deployment in mind and be developed to deploy "anywhere".

## Frontend - Version 3
Version 3 of the application will utilize "Version 2" as the starting point. The goal with this version is all relating to tracking, collecting data, and SEO best practices. New libraries will be used to collect analytics, as well as show analytics through dynamicly created graphs.
