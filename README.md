## Project Structure
This project will be broken down into multiple categories. Front end versions will also correspond with backend versions, ie Frontend/v1 and Backend/v1 are used in conjuction with
eachother. The idea is to progressively develop more efficient versions of the application as time goes on, highlighting how the changes impact performace for the end user, or on
systems hosting the application.
