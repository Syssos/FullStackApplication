1. HASH THE PASSWORDS, this is going to be the first thing highlighted, as its super important to store passwords in a db hashed 
   (v1 is a "mock" or "model" to show proof of concepts, security is not nessisarily important in that version)
2. Refine dataset being used by project, prep for db storage, start breaking down what kind of 
   relationships will be needed for each class attribute being stored.
3. Copy Filestorage class and create a class that does the same things just with a database.
4. Utilize dbstorage over file storage everywhere through out the app.
5. Build out console.py to interact with dbstorage and file storage so data can be pulled from 
   file and stored in db, then viewed(this console will not be packaged with code that gets 
   deployed its more or less a tool for testing with more efficiency).
6. Refine security practices with cookies, tokens, and sessions if need be, ensure all routes are 
   locked down (maybe nmap could give us route insight on things we miss).
7. Create unit tests, configure CI
