# Full Stack Application - Backends
This directory holds all versions of the applications back end. Each version may have different paradigms and programming models, or even use different languages, but will acheive the same task. Each version will contain its own README file, breaking down why certain technologies where used, what can be improved, as well as what is benificial or hindering when taking this approach.

## Backend - Version 1
This version was intended on being a starting point for a project. Dealing with technologies such as python, JS, bootstrap, filestorage, and more to quickly bring the application to life. This approach would be perfect for showing clients a quick example of how the product can work, helping highlight potential long term issues, or unforseen challanges.

## Backend - Version 2
This version of the backend will take "Version 1" and get it production ready. This means isolating trouble-some features/logic, as well as utilizing industry standard tools to ensure the application is "locked down" and safe for a production enviornment. This version will also shift the project into solely relying on a database connection.

## Backend - Version 3
This backend may include the use of new languages, programming paradigms, and more. It will take the Production ready "Version 2" and convert it into an even more efficient software. This version will focus on handling things in "Parrellel" or "Concurrently" to speed up request proccessing times. This version will also make use of new technologies and tools such as load balancing, continous deployment, and more.
