- Containerization
- Databases servers
- Project mockups
- backend
- Frontend
- continous intergration
- continous deployment
- devop tools

Layout:
- Project should be contained within a container. This container can be be pre-configured in verious ways to alter the means of opperation. For example we can have a "testing" container, a "Production" container and so forth

1. Project should start with being mocked first. A python application running in a container that gathers data and stores it locally.
2. A front end should then be mocked up, Interacting with the containerized back end.
3. Testing/CI, Github, and the likes should be configured around front and back end containers, thus ach container can be tested before deployment.



Points to touch on:
- use python to build an initial mock backend, This should handle everything from data collection to data storage, utilizing both file storage methods and databases
-
