"""Hocus Pocus File Storage

The class defined in this file will be used through out the application
to add, change, remove, or view data saved in a file. The file format
of choice is JSON. There is an array of objects stored in a file called
"file.json" containing all of the data used by this file. The database
equivalant of this class will use the same data, however access it via
database connection.

FileStoragedoes has 2 attributes initial assigned to it. You can
find more details on these attributes below. The initial decloration of 
the FileStorage class is held within the "__init__.py" file located in
"/models/__init__.py". For more information on each of the methods of 
this class please see the comment at the top of each method decloration.

__file_path - String, The file location on disk used to gather and store data
__objects - Dictionary/Object, Temporary location in memory of data pulled and pushed to file located at "__file_path"
