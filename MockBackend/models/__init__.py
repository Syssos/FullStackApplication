This file is used to manage the storage object.
The storage object is responsible for retriving,
storing, changing, deleting, or modifing and data
on the application. This storage method can be
changed between a local file storage method utilizing
JSON, and a database storage method, making use of
MySQL and SQLalchemy.

The storage object is utilized as the vehicle for
interaction with the storage means. The classes dictionary
is used throughout the routes, and models files as a means
of tracking the type of classes used by the application.
